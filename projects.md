# Projects

Here are some projects I've worked in the past.

## /Coding

### 1.[Collaborative Content Distribution in 5G Mobile Networks with Edge Caching *(Java)*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8761491)
*(published on 2019 IEEE International Conference on Communications, May, 2019)*
- Considered an integrated content distribution framework with universal in-network caching and collaboration across domains.
- Developed a context-aware solution, which effectively exploits cache collaboration and context information to relieve network congestion.

### 2.[Collaborative Content Distribution with an End-to-End Caching Framework *(Java)*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9040618)
*(published on IEEE Access, May, 2020)*
- Integer Programming, Submoduler Function, Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Introduced an integrated content distribution framework that orchestrates universal in-network caching and enables collaboration across domains.
- Proposed a collaborative content distribution solution, which includes a heuristic social-aware approach for request screening at the mobile edge, and a context-aware approach for video delivery at the integrate edge-core.

### 3.Request Offloading at Mobile Edge with Social-Aware Device Caching *(Java)*
- Focused on exploiting social-aware device caching and user collaboration for efficient content distribution.
- Investigated the request offloading problem, which aims to appropriately select the video requests offloaded to energy-efficient D2D communications.
- Proposed a greedy submodular method that iteratively makes the best offloading decision in each step.

### A World Map Showing COVID-19 Cases *(d3.js)*

## /Interactive Design

### 1.Interaction Optimization of the Corporate Workbench Structure and the ISV Management Structure
*([Chanjet Information Technology Co. Ltd.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chanjet-information-technology-co-ltd-/about/))*
- Took part in the optimization of the Official Website Registration and Logon System, the Corporate Workbench Structure, and the ISV Management Structure.
- Had a good understanding of how interaction designers work, what software they use and how to develop new products.



## /Digital Media

### 1.[One Day in Beijing](https://www.iqiyi.com/v_19rrm3fh9c.html#curid=534189900_undefined)
*(The Best Visual Effects in “Meet China” Virtual Reality (VR) Videos Exhibition Contest, Sep, 2016)*
- After Effects, 3Ds Max
- Worked in a team to make a time-lapse short film about Beijing.
- Shot time-lapse videos of five flag buildings in Beijing, including Tiananmen Square, The Temple of Heaven, Bird’s Nest, Zhongguancun and Galaxy SOHO, and integrated them into a panoramic video.
- Added some information animation to buildings for special effects and tried to make the video immersive through VR technology.

### 2.Trailer of "Lanchuang's Smart Care System with Intel and Tencent"
- After Effects
- Worked in a team to make a trailer for Lanchuang's Smart Care System cooporates with Intel and Tencent.
- Visually showed the end-to-end smart elderly care service model that relies on the IoT technology.
