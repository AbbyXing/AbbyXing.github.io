description: use SCPSolver to solve linear programming problem in your Java project.

## What Is Linear Programing?
>Linear programming, sometimes known as linear optimization, is the problem of maximizing or minimizing a linear function over a convex polyhedron specified by linear and non-negativity constraints. Simplistically, linear programming is the optimization of an outcome based on some set of constraints using a linear mathematical model.

## Why SCPSOlver?
>SCPSolver was developed using Eclipse and optimized using JProfiler.
>It is an easy to use Java Linear Programming Interface.
>It should enable a Java developer to use Linear Programming in 5 minutes.

## Setup
- Download Packs:

There are two packs needed to be downloaded, the GLPK pack and the SCPSolver pack. Both of them can be downloaded [here][scpsolver-website].
- Add to Ecplise Project:

The next step is to add these two packs to our Ecplise project.

## An Easy Example

## Solving Transportation Problem

## A More Complicated Problem (Multi-variables)
Sometimes we are facing a more complex situation, where we have more than one variable. Let's take a look at the following example:  

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(The above problem has been solved in my paper *Collaborative Content Distribution with an End-to-End Caching Framework*, the paper can be viewd [here][paper-link].)
